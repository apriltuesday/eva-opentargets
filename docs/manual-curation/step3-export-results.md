# Manual curation, part III, technical: export curation results and submit feedback to ZOOMA

Before running, set up the environment (Open Targets batches only):
* [Common environment](../open-targets/environment.md)
* [Protocol-specific environment](README.md#setting-up-environment)

## Extract curation results from the spreadsheet

Once the manual curation is completed, download the spreadsheet as a CSV file, making sure that all the data is visible before doing so (i.e., no filters are applied). Save the data to a file `${CURATION_RELEASE_ROOT}/finished_curation_spreadsheet.csv`.

## Run the automated protocol

```bash
cd ${CURATION_RELEASE_ROOT}

# Run the nextflow pipeline, resuming execution of previous attempt if possible.
nextflow run ${CODE_ROOT}/pipelines/export_curation_spreadsheet.nf \
  --input_csv ${CURATION_RELEASE_ROOT}/finished_curation_spreadsheet.csv \
  --curation_root ${CURATION_RELEASE_ROOT} \
  --with_feedback \
  -resume
```


## Submit feedback to EFO
Tables for IMPORT and NEW terms will be created by curators during [step 2](step2-manual-curation.md).
Open a new git issue with EFO to review and import these novel trait names, e.g. [https://github.com/EBISPOT/efo/issues/1898](https://github.com/EBISPOT/efo/issues/1898).


## Submit feedback to ZOOMA
See more details on ZOOMA feedback in the [evidence string generation protocol](../generate-evidence-strings.md#submit-feedback-to-zooma). At this stage, only the **eva_clinvar** dataset is being submitted; clinvar_xrefs is submitted during evidence string generation.

On the Codon cluster, be sure to execute the following on a datamovers node.

```bash
# Create the folder, copy the file to FTP, and update the “latest” folder
FTP_PATH=${FTP_PATH_BASE}/`date +%Y/%m/%d`
mkdir -p ${FTP_PATH}
cp ${BATCH_ROOT_BASE}/manual_curation/eva_clinvar.txt ${FTP_PATH}
cp ${FTP_PATH}/eva_clinvar.txt ${FTP_PATH_BASE}/latest/eva_clinvar.txt
```

After uploading both files, confirm that the changes have propagated to the FTP:
```bash
md5sum ${BATCH_ROOT_BASE}/manual_curation/eva_clinvar.txt
wget -qO- ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/eva/ClinVar/`date +%Y/%m/%d`/eva_clinvar.txt | md5sum
wget -qO- ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/eva/ClinVar/latest/eva_clinvar.txt | md5sum
```
