    Each Trait object contains trait name, how many times it occurs in the input file, and whether it is linked to an NT
    expansion variant.

    Trait occurrence count is calculated based on all unique (RCV, trait name) tuples in the input file. This is because
    each such tuple will, generally speaking, correspond to one output evidence string. So if we want to gauge which
    trait names are more important to curate, we need to consider how many such tuples it appears in.

    Traits which are implicated in "Microsatellite" variants are marked using a special field, because a subset of
    microsatellites are NT expansion variants, and their curation is of highest importance even if the number of records
    which they are linked to is low.
